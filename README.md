# Lightning Launcher
### Fully compatible with Android TV!
### [Available on SideQuest!](https://sidequestvr.com/app/21783)

> [!NOTE]
> **Regarding the new V67 update:**
> 
> Lightning Launcher already works correctly on this version. Make sure to use "open in own window" for your 2D apps *(on by default as of 7.2)* to make the most of the new multitasking features.
>
> *Shortcut services do NOT work correctly in this version.* You may still pin Lightning Launcher and the different shortcuts to the dock, and they will show in the recents section.
