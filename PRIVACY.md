## Automatic Crash Reports
Some versions of Lightning Launcher use Crashlytics, a crash reporting tool provided by Firebase, a business division of Google Inc., 
to send the developer information about bugs and crashes if and when they occur. 
_Crashlytics is NOT included in binaries downloaded from SideQuest or GitHub._

This information is used only for the improvement of the application, and will never be shared or sold.


Crashlytics automatically collects certain non-personally identifying information including information on device hardware and software,
application state, and device state at the time of the crash.

Please check [Firebase's privacy policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/) for more information about Crashlytics.
